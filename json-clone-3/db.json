Since then, we’ve prepared approximately 800 million tax returns and grown to have approximately 12,000 offices throughout the United States and around the world. We know that tax needs and situations change from year to year. That’s why we offer new and innovative ways to prepare and file taxes so clients can choose what suits them best.\n\nWe are a people company first and a tax company second. With this in mind, we deliver care in every interaction, conversation, and at each touchpoint. That’s how we build long-lasting relationships with clients, communities, and associates.\n\nPeople who join H&R Block say it feels like being part of something bigger. A place with an amazing and storied history, but with a strong and urgent focus on the future. Maybe it's because our company still has the feeling of ‘family’ serving as the foundation for our associates and franchisees who bring our purpose to life each day. Maybe it’s how determined, forward thinking and innovative we are, or how accessible our leadership is. We believe it’s all those things, and much more.\n\nOur ideas are rooted in unique and diverse perspectives fueled by curiosity and creativity. We’re not afraid to try new things, and never rest on past success. We are passionate in the way we advocate for each other, for our clients, and most importantly, we not only say we are better together…we truly believe it!",
